# Coursera-Machine-Learning-Regression
A place for source code or python notebook of my work for this coursera specialization

## About

I would like to use this place to share course related information with other certificate seekers.
The course content is not as easy as abc. I some quizs and assignments could be rather tough. So I will try to present my work for the quizs and assignment clearly. Hope everyone gets the most from the course.

**Disclaimer**
The main purpose is not to help people cheat for certificates, but rather to share peer work for better understanding on course content.

##Machine Learning Foundations: Regression##
You can find the source code for my assignment in the ipynb files under the corresponding folders. Certain ipython notebook cells are marked, for example,  *# Assignment Quiz X*, so that you can easily find the sections mapping to quiz questions.
